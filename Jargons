Clustering ... unsupervised, the algorithm doesn't know about classes
Clasification ... supervised, the algorithm already knows what possible classes and their definitions

- K-Means Algorithm

1. Assign cluster number RANDOMLY to all items.
2. calculate CENTER of cluster(average) 
3. assign all items again, using updated CENTER
